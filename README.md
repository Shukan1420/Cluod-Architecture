# Cluod-Architecture
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting the design and implementation of a cloud architecture tailored specifically for FutureTech Institute, a leading educational institution. This project is part of a course assignment and is structured into different phases, each representing a significant milestone in the cloud architecture design process. From requirements gathering to performance optimization, each phase will be meticulously documented with detailed descriptions, diagrams, and scripts. We encourage contributions and feedback from the community to enhance the cloud architecture design and ensure its effectiveness in supporting FutureTech Institute's operations. Thank you for your interest in our project, and we look forward to collaborating with you on this exciting endeavor.
